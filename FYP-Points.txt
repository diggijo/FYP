Reword research question. Yes or No answer. Can you buid a digital twin to mimic real time crane movement?

Modern visualisation products.

Case Study - Existing UI, picture. Description of how its used on daily basis. Is it stored? Where? Describe existing product.
Diagnostics and Monitoring. Crane Management System. WPF language.
INFORMATION OVERLOAD. TOO MUCH NOISE
Messaging system on every day in PLC.
Crane monitoring & Crane Diagnostics in the form of average metrics.
Engineering level monitoring.
One stop shop for all metrics.
Collects data:
Directly off Crane PLC using SignalR & OPC
From trace file. Every hour on the crane. ~35000 signals.
From feedback array in PLC. Builds job and load statistics tables in SQL.
TCPIP collections out of port 6000-5000. PLC specific interface to listen and sends data to a client server architecture in datagram packet. Has to be stripped headered etc in c#.

OPC Server connected to PLC and we query it for certain variables and send to azure database.
